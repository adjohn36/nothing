    certifications: `I graduated from Tech Elevator, a full stack web development bootcamp, in August 2023.  
    My coding languages of focus were Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also utilizing many different programs in order to write, test, and debug code.
    It was a 14 week bootcamp where we learned how to create a dynamic web-based software system.  The course provided 800+ hours of development education and application.
